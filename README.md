Cloud Cottage is a digital house built to share content with my friend Gretchen.

Tools used: 
REACT/REACT ROUTER
The interface was built in React and the routing is handled by React Router.

AIRTABLE API
The content links are stored and redistributed in the house using the Airtable API and an Airtable base. 

EMAILJS
Participants get an email when someone leaves content for them. EmailJS is a free email service that allows emails to be sent from React. Variables allow emails to be sent to the correct participant. 

PARTICLES.JS
The basement has a particle animation that is rendered using particles.js, a lightweight library for creating particles.
